We are a group of Universities students in Singapore, that collaborated together on this project that is organised by TikTok. 
For this group assignment, we chose Project A, where we were tasked to build a Front-End Development project, a Hangman Game using 
web technologies that we have learned in the workshop.

**Overview of Project & How to Play:**

The objective of this project is to build a Hangman Game together as a group. For our project, it is a single player game whereby a topic will be given to the player at the start of each game. Player has to guess the word by guessing each individual letter. For each incorrect guess, it brings you one step closer to being "hanged" (max 7 attempts). For each correct and incorrect letter guessed by the player, a sound effect will be played (indicating a successful or unseccuessful guess). After each round, user has to click on the reset button to restart the game.
This game helps users to sharpen their word-decoding skills. Our game is supported on mobile, tablet and desktop


**How did we improve User's experience:**
- Implemented responsive buttons upon clicking each letter
- Displaying the hangman image 
- A sound effect will be played for every correct guess
- Gradient background and cuter font for aesthetic purposes
- Upon every succesful guess, a message "You Won!" will be displayed and for every failed attempt, a message "You Lost!" will be displayed together with the answer
- Added the number of attempts left (max 7 attempts) in the game
